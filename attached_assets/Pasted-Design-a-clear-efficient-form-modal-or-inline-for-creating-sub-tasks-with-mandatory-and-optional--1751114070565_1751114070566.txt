Design a clear, efficient form (modal or inline) for creating sub-tasks with mandatory and optional fields, ensuring consistency with the parent task while allowing customization.

Core Requirements
1. Form Fields & Rules
Field	Mandatory?	Default Behavior & Rules
Sub-task Name	Yes (M)	- Default text: "New Sub-Task"
- Max 60 chars.
- Inline edit on click (if in list view).
Assigned To	Yes (M)	- Dropdown: Searchable, single-select.
- Default: Current user ("Self").
- Avatar + name display.
Due Date	Yes (M)	- Auto-filled: Matches parent task’s due date.
- Priority override: If priority is set (e.g., "Critical" → due date adjusts to sooner).
- Manual edit allowed (date picker).
Priority	No (O)	- Default: "Low".
- Options: Low, Medium, High, Critical (color-coded).
- Affects due date logic if not manually set.
Status	Yes (M)	- Default: "To Do".
- Options: To Do, In Progress, Blocked, Completed (with icons/colors).
- Visual badge in list view.
Visibility	Yes (M)	- Default: Inherits parent’s visibility (e.g., "Company-wide").
- Optional override (dropdown).
Description	No (O)	- Rich text editor (bold, bullets, links).
- Collapsible in list view.
Attachments	No (O)	- Drag-and-drop zone + file upload button.
- Thumbnail previews for images/docs.
2. Interaction & UI
Modal (if separate):

Title: "Add Sub-task" with parent task name as context (e.g., "Under: [Parent Task]").

Save/Cancel buttons (primary action sticky to bottom).

Inline (if in-list):

Auto-focus on "Sub-task Name" field.

Save on blur or explicit "✓" button.

Validation:

Highlight empty mandatory fields (e.g., red outline for "Sub-task Name" if blank).

3. Conditional Logic
Due Date & Priority:

If user manually edits due date, priority becomes "—" (custom).

If priority is changed → due date adjusts dynamically (e.g., "High" → +1 day from today).

4. Empty States & Helpers
Placeholder text:

Description: "Add internal notes or instructions…"

Attachments: "Drag files here or click to upload."

Tooltips:

Explain "Visibility" inheritance.

Clarify priority/due date relationship.
