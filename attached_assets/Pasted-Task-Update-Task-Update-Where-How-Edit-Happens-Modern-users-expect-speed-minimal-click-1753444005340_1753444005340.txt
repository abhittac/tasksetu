🔄 Task Update – Where & How Edit Happens
Modern users expect speed, minimal clicks, and in-context editing. So, instead of sending users to a separate "Edit Page," Tasksetu will support contextual editing from wherever the user is interacting with tasks:
Task Update is not task life cycle, it is updating/editing the task details.
Task Status Update – in every view
 1. Task List View (Table/Grid or Kanban)
Trigger	Action
Click on Task Name or ID	Opens Task Detail Modal (Modal Coming in from Right) for full edit
Hover on editable fields (e.g. Assignee, Due Date, Priority)	Shows pencil/edit icon → click to inline-edit in place
Bulk Edit Option (Future Enhancement)	Checkbox-select multiple rows → shows “Bulk Edit” toolbar
✅ Why? Fastest way for users working with multiple tasks
🧠 Design Tip: Show minimal indicators unless user hovers or selects

2. Task Detail Modal (Default Edit Container)
Where	Action
Fields like Task Name, Priority, Due Date, Assignee, Description, etc.	Editable directly from this modal. “Save” button
“More” Section	Opens a second modal (drawer or popover) for advanced settings like custom form, dependencies, related process
Collaborators	Added via searchable multi-select inside this modal
✅ Why? Familiar interaction, full field visibility, fewer distractions
🧠 Design Tip: Split into collapsible sections for better readability

3. Kanban / Calendar / My Day View (Mini Update)
Trigger	Action
Click on Task Card	Opens Task Quick View drawer from right side, showing key info (assignee, due date, status, description)
Click “Edit” or icon inside	Converts into inline editing controls or opens full Task Modal
Drag-drop in calendar / Kanban – (Future Enhancement)	Updates date or status directly, without opening anything
✅ Why? Great for quick updates without breaking workflow
🧠 Design Tip: Use soft transitions, auto-save where possible


Notification or Activity Feed (Jump-to-Edit) – (Future Enhancement)
Trigger	Action
User clicks on task reference in notification or feed	Opens Task Detail Modal in editable mode, directly focusing on the field they were notified about (e.g., overdue date)
✅ Why? Brings the user exactly to where they need to act
🧠 Design Tip: Highlight the affected field for 2-3 seconds to draw attention.

2.	Task Detail Modal opens with editable fields.
3.	Inline fields like Task Name, Assignee, and Due Date become editable on click.
