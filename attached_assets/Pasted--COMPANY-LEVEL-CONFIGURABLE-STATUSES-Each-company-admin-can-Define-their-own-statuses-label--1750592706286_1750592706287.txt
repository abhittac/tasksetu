🏢 COMPANY-LEVEL CONFIGURABLE STATUSES
Each company admin can:
•	Define their own statuses, label them, order them.
•	Choose which ones are “active” vs “final” statuses.
•	Map status change rules (e.g., "On Hold" can go back only to "Open" or "In Progress").
•	Set default status for newly created tasks/sub-tasks.
UI for Admin (Company Settings > Task Settings > Status Configuration):
•	Add New Status (Text, Color Picker, Description)
•	Drag-drop to reorder
•	Mark as “Default” or “Final Status”
•	Option to “Hide system statuses” (if fully custom)

**** The same kind of logic shall be applicable for priority settings as well ****

🧱 1. System-Defined Statuses (Tasksetu Core Layer)
These are required to support core application logic, analytics, and consistency across features.
Example system statuses:
•	Not Started
•	In Progress
•	On Hold
•	Completed
•	Cancelled
System status codes (e.g. SYS_NOT_STARTED) will never change, and must be used internally.

🏢 2. Company-Defined Statuses (Custom Layer)
Companies can configure their own statuses via Admin Panel.
Examples:
•	Pending → mapped to Not Started
•	Working On → mapped to In Progress
•	Blocked → mapped to On Hold
•	Closed, Done → both mapped to Completed
🧩 Rules:
•	One system status can have multiple company statuses.
•	Each company status must be mapped to a valid system status.
•	Mapping is mandatory at the time of status creation or update.
•	Company can edit names, colors, order, but not delete a system status mapping.

⚙️ 3. Admin Status Configuration Flow
Step-by-step:
1.	Admin goes to Company Settings → Status Management
2.	Sees existing company-defined statuses (editable inline)
3.	Can click “+ Add New Status”
o	Enters Status Name
o	Selects Color
o	Must map to a system status from dropdown
4.	On Save, system checks:
o	All system statuses have at least one mapping
o	No duplication of status names
o	System prompts: “Changing a status will affect existing tasks”

🔄 4. What Happens to Existing Tasks?
If a company renames or remaps a status:
•	Existing tasks remain unchanged in database (linked to system code)
•	UI dynamically renders using updated company-defined label
•	Activity feed records:
"Task status updated display from ‘Pending’ to ‘New Pending’"
🛑 If a company tries to delete a status, system prevents it if it’s being used — or offers a merge option (move tasks to a different company status mapped to same system status).


🌐 6. UI Considerations
•	Status shown in dropdowns (e.g., task cards, Kanban board) will show company-defined statuses with color tags
•	Admin view will have table:
