This is the primary popup/modal shown when a user clicks “Create Task”.

🟨 At the bottom / or somewhere else of this modal, there is a [More Options] button / icon. Clicking this opens the Advanced Fields modal.

🔹 "More Options" Modal (Advanced Fields)
These are less frequently used fields but important for teams working in structured environments.
Field Name	Type	Required	Behavior & Description
Reference Process	Dropdown (Searchable)	❌ No	Link this task to a predefined process (like a standard operating procedure).
Custom Form	Dropdown (Searchable)	❌ No	Select a form template to collect specific data with the task. Cannot create forms here.
Dependencies	Multiselect Dropdown	❌ No	Choose existing tasks that must be completed before this one starts.
Task Type	Dropdown (Simple, Recurring, Approval)	✅ Yes	Default = Simple. Defines the kind of task being created.

🔁 Dynamic Behavior (System-Controlled)
🎯 Priority-to-Due-Date Logic (Managed by Backend Table – both priority & priority vs due date configuration)
Instead of hardcoding the number of days between creation and default due date, this is stored in a master table, allowing admins to later adjust the logic without code changes.
Priority	Default Days to Due Date (T+x)
Low	T + 30 days
Medium	T + 14 days
High	T + 7 days
Critical	T + 2 days
•	T = Today's date (date of task creation)
•	If the user selects a Due Date manually, it overrides the default logic.
🎯 If Task Type is selected as “Recurring”

•	Due Date should become blank and un-editable.
•	Somewhere near task type, a pop-up/ modal/card should open.
•	Showing Calendar – multi select dates.
•	Drop Down showing Dates “Every – DDL” of month.
•	Drop Down showing days “Every – DDL” of week.
•	Only one of the above three should be selectable. 
•	System captures this information which will be used further in the system.

Priority	Default Days to Due Date (T+x)
Low	T + 30 days
Medium	T + 14 days
High	T + 7 days
Critical	T + 2 days
•	T = Today's date (date of task creation)
•	If the user selects a Due Date manually, it overrides the default logic.


🧠 User Experience Design Considerations
UX Feature	Description
Inline Task Name Edit	Like Asana — user clicks on task name and directly edits it. Auto-saves when clicked outside.
Live Feedback & Validation	Real-time alerts if required fields are missed or input formats are invalid.
Searchable Drop-downs	All user-selection fields are searchable with live filtering.
Default Autofill	Smart pre-fills (e.g., Priority = Low, Due Date = +30 days) to save time.
Context-Aware Visibility	Only relevant fields are shown depending on whether the user is in an organization or a single-user environment.
