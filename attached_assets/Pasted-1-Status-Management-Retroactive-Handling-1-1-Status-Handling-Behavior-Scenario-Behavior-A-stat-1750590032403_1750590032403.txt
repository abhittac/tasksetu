1. Status Management & Retroactive Handling
1.1 Status Handling Behavior
Scenario	Behavior
A status is renamed	Tasks auto-update the label (no data loss)
A status is deleted	Admin prompted to map to a new status
A new default is set	Affects only future tasks
1.2 Data Integrity
•	Historical logs retain retired statuses
•	Legacy mapping table ensures reports don’t break
1.3 User Experience
•	Status pills are color-coded (configurable)
•	Dropdown shows only valid next statuses
•	Autosave enabled on blur
•	Tooltips explain each status
1.4 Backend Schema
status_master
•	status_id, label, description, color, is_final, is_default, company_id, active_flag
task_status_history
•	task_id, previous_status_id, new_status_id, changed_by, changed_at
