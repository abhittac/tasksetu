
Recurring Task
🔹 Purpose:
Allow users to create tasks that repeat automatically based on defined recurrence rules — reducing manual effort for repetitive workflows like daily check-ins, weekly reports, monthly reviews, etc.

🧩 Where Recurring Logic Appears
📍 Task Creation Modal
•	Section: “Make this a recurring task”
o	Checkbox: “Repeat this task”
	When checked, recurrence options appear

📋 Recurrence Options (Modal or Inline Expandable Section)
Field	Type	Behavior/Options
Frequency	Dropdown	Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Custom
Repeat Every	Input	Numeric (e.g. every 2 days, every 3 weeks)
Repeat On (for weekly)	Checkboxes	Mon, Tue, Wed...
Start Date	Date	Defaults to today
End Condition	Radio	• Never Ends
• Ends after N occurrences
• Ends by specific date
Time of Creation	Optional	If defined, system will use this to auto-create task on that time (else default)

🤖 System Behaviour
🔄 How It Works
•	System generates a new task based on the recurrence pattern.
•	Each recurrence is treated as a new standalone task.
•	The new task copies fields like: name, description, assignee, priority, tags, etc.
•	It auto-updates the due date based on pattern.

🔐 Permissions & Editing
User Type	Rights
Task Creator	Can create, edit, or stop recurrence
Assignee	Cannot change recurrence, but can edit individual task instance
Admin	Can view all recurrences across company (if needed for reports or corrections)

🧠 System Data Model (Backend)
RecurringTaskMaster Table
Field Name	Description
id	Unique ID
creator_user_id	Who created this pattern
base_task_id	The task from which recurrence started
frequency	Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Custom
repeat_every	Interval number
repeat_on_days	If weekly, which days (comma list)
start_date	From when recurrence begins
end_condition_type	Never / AfterN / EndDate
end_value	e.g. 5 (occurrences) or 2025-12-31
active	Boolean

🔔 Notifications
•	When a new instance is created via recurrence logic:
o	The assignee receives a normal task creation notification.
o	If collaborators were defined in base task, they're notified too.

🖼️ UX Considerations
Area	Behavior
Calendar View	Only upcoming instance(s) visible, not all future repeats
Task List	Shows each instance as a separate task with recurrence icon (🔁)
Task Detail View	Shows “Recurring from Task #1234” if it’s part of a recurring pattern
Manage Recurring Tasks	New tab under "My Tasks" or "Company Tasks" to list and manage patterns
Editing a Recurring Task	Only the master pattern can be edited for future instances
Stopping Recurrence	Button: "Stop recurrence" – removes only future generation, not past

⚠️ Edge Cases & Fail Safes
Case	Handling
User deletes master task	Prompt: “This will stop recurrence. Are you sure?”
Company disables recurrence	Existing ones remain, but no new ones can be created
Assignee changed mid-recurring	Only affects future instances post-change
Weekend creation logic (optional)	Provide toggle: “Skip weekends” or “Adjust to next business day”

✅ Example Use Cases
Use Case	How It Works
Weekly Team Sync Task	Repeats every Monday at 10:00 AM with same assignees & forms
Monthly Vendor Invoice Audit	Repeats on 1st of every month, ends after 12 cycles
Daily Stand-up	Task created every weekday, due same day, auto-closed if not updated
Annual Self-Appraisal Form	Recurs every year with a form attached, sent to employee email

🎯 If Task Type is selected as “Recurring”
•	Due Date should become blank and un-editable.
•	Somewhere near task type, a pop-up/ modal/card should open.
•	Showing Calendar – multi select dates.
•	Drop Down showing Dates “Every – DDL” of month.
•	Drop Down showing days “Every – DDL” of week.
•	Only one of the above three should be selectable. 
•	System captures this information which will be used further in the system.

Priority	Default Days to Due Date (T+x)
Low	T + 30 days
Medium	T + 14 days
High	T + 7 days
Critical	T + 2 days
•	T = Today's date (date of task creation)
•	If the user selects a Due Date manually, it overrides the default logic.
