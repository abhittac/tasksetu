✏️ Sub-task Creation UX – Flow
Step 1: User opens a Task (Task View screen)

•	Clicks on + Add Sub-task
Step 2: Sub-task Input Modal or Inline Add opens
•	User enters Sub-task Name
•	Assigns user (search dropdown)
•	Selects priority (optional)
•	Due date auto-suggested based on priority and today's date (from backend config)
•	Clicks Create
Step 3: Sub-task appears under parent
•	Collapsed by default (expandable)
•	Assigned person gets notified
•	If a collaborator was added in the parent, they also get update (if notification rules apply)

•	Click-to-edit fields: Task name, due date, and priority can be edited inline on hover.
•	Visual Indicators: Overdue sub-tasks show in red, completed are struck-through.
•	Keyboard Shortcuts: Allow Enter to add sub-task, Tab to move to next field.
