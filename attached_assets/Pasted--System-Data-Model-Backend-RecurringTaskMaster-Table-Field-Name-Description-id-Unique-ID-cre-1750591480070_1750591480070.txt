🧠 System Data Model (Backend)
RecurringTaskMaster Table
Field Name	Description
id	Unique ID
creator_user_id	Who created this pattern
base_task_id	The task from which recurrence started
frequency	Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Custom
repeat_every	Interval number
repeat_on_days	If weekly, which days (comma list)
start_date	From when recurrence begins
end_condition_type	Never / AfterN / EndDate
end_value	e.g. 5 (occurrences) or 2025-12-31
active	Boolean

🔔 Notifications
•	When a new instance is created via recurrence logic:
o	The assignee receives a normal task creation notification.
o	If collaborators were defined in base task, they're notified too.

🖼️ UX Considerations
Area	Behavior
Calendar View	Only upcoming instance(s) visible, not all future repeats
Task List	Shows each instance as a separate task with recurrence icon (🔁)
Task Detail View	Shows “Recurring from Task #1234” if it’s part of a recurring pattern
Manage Recurring Tasks	New tab under "My Tasks" or "Company Tasks" to list and manage patterns
Editing a Recurring Task	Only the master pattern can be edited for future instances
Stopping Recurrence	Button: "Stop recurrence" – removes only future generation, not past

⚠️ Edge Cases & Fail Safes
Case	Handling
User deletes master task	Prompt: “This will stop recurrence. Are you sure?”
Company disables recurrence	Existing ones remain, but no new ones can be created
Assignee changed mid-recurring	Only affects future instances post-change
Weekend creation logic (optional)	Provide toggle: “Skip weekends” or “Adjust to next business day”
